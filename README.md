Playground Functions is a project developed to practice and explore different functions and programming concepts. The goal is to create an interactive learning environment where users can experiment and test different JavaScript functions.

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Pre-implemented Functions**: Playground Functions already includes a series of pre-implemented functions that address different programming concepts and challenges.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## Installation

Playground Functions is a project for my improvement in JavaScript logic and does not require installation, only includes some functions that perform certain logics.

## Key Learnings

I was able to start applying programming logic in JavaScript, manipulating data in variables, using functions, and other basic and fundamental concepts.

## Conclusion

Although it is a small project with little substance, it was essential for my initial development in the world of JavaScript development!
